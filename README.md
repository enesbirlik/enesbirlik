##  About Me

I'm a mechatronics engineer passionate about developing modular, autonomous systems.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **mechanical design, embedded systems, and ROS-based control architectures** ‚Äî creating robots that move, perceive, and make decisions.

 I design and build:
- ROS2-based robotic architectures
- Autonomous rover platforms
- Manipulator motion planning systems
- Digital twins for real-time monitoring and debugging

 What sets me apart:  
I work **end-to-end** ‚Äî simulation ‚Üí embedded firmware ‚Üí perception ‚Üí control ‚Üí field testing.
